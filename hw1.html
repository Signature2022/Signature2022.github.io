		<p> I like how John Berger talks about how perspective is relative to the eye. How appearances can change, how a european painting will be interpreted differently than how a camera picture will be. I don't disagree with anything he said. I like a lot of what he's talking about. Camera's were able to take a painting and replicate many times with many different sizes. I like how it changed the culture behind paintings. I like how although it made paintings more available, it made the originals even more valuable. I like how he says paintings now can be manipulated by adding movement and sound, cutting pieces out of the painting that are actually there and changing the whole meaning of the picture. Music can change the meaning behind a painting. It all goes back to how we interpret paintings.   </p>
