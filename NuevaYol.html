	<h1> Thoughts </h1>
	<div > 
		<p>The article, "Society of the Spectacle" by Guy Debord is a really fascinating read. </p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p> I was really trying to grasp what the Spectale actually was, it felt like there a million definitions for this word and what it actually meant</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>What I found to be a really good description of the Spectacle was when Debord stated "The spectacle presents itself as something enormously positive, indisputable and inaccessible." </p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>This was a really deep and profound way to think about the Spectacle was and it brought deeper meaing to what a Society of the Spectacle would be</p>
